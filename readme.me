This repository is your step-by-step guide to diving into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo will take you through the foundational concepts, practical implementations, and advanced techniques, with a focus on tools like LangChain, knowledge graphs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and much more.

1-chatgpt basic example
2-lang-chain basic usage of the langchain library
3-streaming basic usage of the streaming callback handler
4-two-chains basic usage of two chains in langchain 
5-two-chains-composition builds on the two-chains example by demonstrating how to compose multiple chains together for more complex workflows.
6-simpler-templates introduces simpler templates for creating prompts, making it easier to customize and reuse them.
7-batch-multi-model shows how to handle batch processing with multiple models, improving efficiency and scalability.
8-async explores asynchronous processing techniques to enhance performance and responsiveness.
9-crawler provides an example of a web crawler that leverages LLMs for extracting and processing information from websites.
